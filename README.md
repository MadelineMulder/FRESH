This is a repository for the final PLUS Practice for Software Development class for the FRESH project on routing during hurricane Dorian on Grand Bahama Island. 

FRESH stands for **F**lood **R**outing for **E**mergency **S**ervices for **H**urricanes. 

This project was meant to continue the work begun in this project (read more here). The impetus for this project was to translate the world done in javascript into python using osmnx and folium. 

The end result of this project is a web application created through Flask which hosts two apps, a routing app which allows users to input coordinates for the Grand Bahama Island and recieve routing results, and a hurricane visualization app which displays the dynamic path of hurricane Dorian as it approaches the Grand Bahama island over a series of days.  

In addition to the web application with the routing and hurricane apps a website was also developed to provide background and documentation for the project using Github pages. The website can be found here:
