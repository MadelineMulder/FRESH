# FRESH
*This is a repository for the final PLUS Practice for Software Development class (summer semester 2023).*  

FRESH stands for **F**lood **R**outing for **E**mergency **S**ervices for **H**urricanes. 

The FRESH project focuses on network analysis and visualization on Grand Bahama Island during hurricane Dorian (2019). The project was meant to continue the work begun during the [Foresight DRM: Disaster Mapping Hackathon 2023](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/f819f3563aef4cad8cfae7072eed0d07). The impetus for this project was to translate the web application that was created during the Hackathon from javascript to python using OSMnx and Folium. 

The end result of this project is a web application created through Flask which hosts two apps:
- A routing app which allows users to input starting and end coordinates on the Grand Bahama Island and recieve routing results for the best path between the two points
- A hurricane visualization app which displays the dynamic path of hurricane Dorian as it approaches the Grand Bahama island over a series of days.  

In addition to the web application with the routing and hurricane apps a website was also developed to provide background and documentation for the project using Github pages. The website can be found here: [FRESH Project Website](https://madelinemulder.github.io/FRESH/index.html)
