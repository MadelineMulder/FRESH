      <h1>About this Project</h1>
      <p>Natural disasters are formidable events that have caused a lot of havoc around the world. Presently, these disasters have become more persistent and peculiar thus the need to leverage technology to study and analyze the patterns. The aim of this project is to create a python-based web application focused on identifying accessible routes during natural disasters. Specifically, the web application will identify the best path between points during flood events that have been caused by hurricanes. To scale this project appropriately, the web application will focus on one specific area and hurricane, Hurricane Dorian which hit the Grand Bahama Island in 2019.</p> 
      
      <p>The app will serve two purposes: analysis and visualization (of routing during a flood event). To fulfill its purpose, the app will include visualizations of various data layers including landcover, flood masks, buildings, and streets as well as a visualization of the hurricane path. Additionally, the application will analyze the best path for a user to take in order to avoid flooded areas and reach their destination as fast as possible. Ideally, users will be able to identify a start point and an end point on the map and the application will analyze flood and network data consequently returning the fastest and most accessible route for users to take between their points.</p>   
      
      <p>To accomplish this, group members will use OSMnx for routing analysis as well as Django and Folium to build and visualize a web map of the data layers and routing results. The expected outcome is a web map that includes various data layers, a visualization of Hurricane Dorianâ€™s path, and network analysis capabilities which take into account flood data.</p>
      
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <ol>
      <li>To simulate the tracking of the movement of Hurricane Dorian on its path towards Grand Bahama Island</li>
      <li>To create an interactive web mapping application that conducts a network analysis of available routes during the flood event caused by Hurricane Dorian</li>
      <li>To design a user interactive interface that allows users to choose two points of interest between which the best route will be calculated in the face of the flooding caused by Hurricane Dorian</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Case Study</h2>
      <p>Grand Bahama was hit by Hurricane Dorian in 2019 which got an effect on society and natural environment in the country. the hurricane made damage amounted to US$3.4 billion, and there were at least 74 deaths in the country. Another 282 people were left missing after the hurricane</p>
